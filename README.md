# of-the-star's Flake Templates

Really I just wanted to use 'flake-utils' and didn't like the way the official flake templates were written. Why aren't all the inputs in a single attrset?? That would make it *so* much more readable and easier to understand. IMO, seeing flakes as the functions that they are, with specific inputs and outputs is the best way to understand them, and the way they're written in the official templates repo obfuscates that a little to someone who's trying to grasp the concept of flakes.
